**Weedon Island and Remote Sensing**

How Can Remote Sensing Be Useful To Archaeologists?

Archaeologists use many different kinds of tools to 'dig' up the past. Beyond excavation, or laboratory analysis, there are other tools available that help answer questions about the past or study historic or prehistoric sites. Remote Sensing is one such technique that can be used to investigate archaeological sites. Let's look at Weedon Island in Florida and see what Archaeology can investigate with Remote Sensing data.

**What is Remote Sensing?**

1. the use of an instrument, such as a radar device or camera, to scan the earth 
or another planet from space in order to collect data about some aspect of it

**What Remote Sensing data is available for Weedon Island?**

Aerial Photographs from the 1940s to the present are available for Florida

In 1943, the U.S. Department of Agriculture collected aerial imagry:

Lidar data is available from the NOAA Office of Coastal Management. This data can be used to develop a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) showing the elevation, or topography, of the island.

How has Weedon Island changed over time?

The airfield that was present on the island is no longer there, but can you spot it on the 1943 or 1957 aerial image?
