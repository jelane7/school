###More Than Mapping: How Can Remote Sensing Be Useful To Archaeologists?

Archaeologists use many different kinds of tools to 'dig' up the past. Beyond excavation, or laboratory analysis, there are other tools available that help answer questions about the past or study historic or prehistoric sites. Remote Sensing is one such technique that can be used to investigate archaeological sites. Let's look at Weedon Island in Florida and see what Archaeology can investigate with Remote Sensing data.

What data is available for Remote Sensing?

Lidar data is available from the NOAA Office of Coastal Management. This data can be used to develop a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) showing the elevation, or topography, of the island.
